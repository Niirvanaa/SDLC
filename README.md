software development life cycle course 
I interpret the users' needs by gathering as much information as I can from the user stories. User stories are detailed descriptions of what the user requires and wants from the new software we are developing. They help give insight into the real goals behind the project.

When I approach developing a program, I use a product backlog to turn user stories into tangible steps. The backlog organizes all the tasks, features, and improvements based on priority, making it easier to plan each sprint. One useful Agile process I would incorporate is Sprint Planning, where the team selects which user stories to focus on for a set time period and commits to delivering them. This keeps the work structured and ensures we're always delivering value to the user.

In software development, being a good team member means collaborating well with others, communicating in a respectful and efficient manner, meeting deadlines, and having a strong sense of responsibility for both your team and the project. A good team member supports others, stays adaptable, and contributes to a positive and productive work environment.
